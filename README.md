# Snake Game 2D (Lua)

Welcome to Snake Game 2D in Lua\! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake, guiding it to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. This project utilizes Lua and the **L√ñVE 2D framework** for game development.

-----

## Requirements

To compile and run Snake Game 2D in Lua, you need the following:

  - **Lua 5.x:** L√ñVE 2D is built on Lua, so a compatible Lua environment is inherently part of the L√ñVE 2D installation.
  - **L√ñVE 2D:** A free, open-source 2D game framework that handles graphics, audio, input, and other game development necessities.

-----

## Dependencies

Snake Game 2D for Lua depends on the following:

  - The **L√ñVE 2D framework** (no external Lua libraries are explicitly required beyond what L√ñVE provides).

-----

## Usage

To run Snake Game 2D in Lua, follow these steps:

1.  **Install L√ñVE 2D:** Download and install L√ñVE 2D from its official website: [https://love2d.org/](https://love2d.org/)

      * For **Windows**, drag the project folder onto `love.exe`.
      * For **macOS**, drag the project folder onto the L√ñVE application icon.
      * For **Linux**, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        love .
        ```
        If you're using an AppImage, ensure it's executable and specify its path followed by the project folder's path:
        ```bash
        ./love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage ./
        ```
        (Replace `./love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage` with the actual path to your L√ñVE AppImage if it's not in the current directory, and `./` with the path to the `main.lua`'s containing folder if it's not in the current directory).

2.  **Run the Game:**

      * Navigate to the project's root directory (where `main.lua` is located).
      * Execute the game using your L√ñVE 2D installation as described above.

Enjoy playing Snake Game 2D\!
